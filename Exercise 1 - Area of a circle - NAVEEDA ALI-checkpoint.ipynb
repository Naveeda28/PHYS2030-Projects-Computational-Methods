    "Here is a classic exercise to estimate $\\pi$ by calculating the area of a circle. Consider the following figure. We have a circle of radius $r=1$, centered at the origin. The circle is inscribed inside a square, whose corners are at the points $(x,y) = (\\pm 1, \\pm 1)$.\n",

    "We make a Monte Carlo simulation of $N$ random points within the square by sampling for $x$ and $y$, each sampled from a uniform distribution between \n",

    "$$-1 \\le x,y \\le +1 \\, .$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Each sample here will consist of two values $x_i, y_i$, each chosen randomly. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, consider the probability $p$ that our sampled point lies within a circle, satisfying\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\sqrt{x_i^2 + y_i^2} < 1 \\, .$$\n",

    "This probability $p$ is equal to the ratio of the areas:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$p = \\frac{\\rm area \\; of \\; circle}{\\rm area \\; of \\; square} = \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\, . \\qquad (1) $$\n",

    "For our simulation, we expect that the number of sampled points inside the circle is \n",
